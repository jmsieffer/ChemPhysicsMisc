''' This project is mostly a recreation of a blog post by Cory Chu at
https://blog.gwlab.page/solving-1-d-schrodinger-equation-in-python-dcb3518ce454. 
After following some of his work, I also attempted to do his suggested simulations.
The goal of this project was to solve the Schr√∂dinger Equation for a SHO. After this
I will make an animation of some osscilations in the model.  '''

#Start by defining our conditions
dx = 0.02 #Spatial seperation
x = np.arange(0,10,dx) #Create our spatial dimension


#Wave Packet conditions
k = 0.1 #Wave number 
m = 1 #mass 
sigma = 0.1 #Width of Gaussian
x0 = 3 #Center of initial packet


Norm = 1 / (sigma * np.sqrt(sc.constants.pi)) #Normalization Constant


#Initial Wavefunction for Wavepacket
psi0 = np.sqrt(Norm)* np.exp(-(x-x0)/(2*sigma)) *np.exp(1j*k*x)

#Creating our potential 
Vxmin = 5 #Minimum point for potential
T = 1  #Period of SHO
w = (2 * np.pi)/ T#Angular Velocity
scaling = 0.001 #Scaling factor 
V = ((k/2)*(x - Vxmin)**2)*scaling #Potential function


#Solve the intial conditions for our SE
dt = 0.005 #Time spacing
t0 = 0 #Initial Time    
tf = 1 #Final Time
t_interval = np.arange(t0,tf,dt)

#We then create our laplace operator which will convert the wavefunction into a single variable function.
#The matrix which is our laplace operator is banded, so we can use scipy's sparse feature.

                    [-1,0,1],

#Defining our Schrodinger Equation as psi_t
