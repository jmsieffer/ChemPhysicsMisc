# ChemPhysicsMisc
This is for mostly simple projects and messing with new functions. Most of the projects  
in here are vaguely related to my PhD Preparation, and the *Latex* document that goes with that.  
Anyone is free to use anything from this repository, though I'm not sure why anyone would  
want to do that.
